# rhogen
A star system generator inspired by the Worldbuilding guidelines from Atomic Rockets.

Todo:

- unify star and planet generation so that entire systems can be generated
- implement some kind of deconfliction logic to avoid planets that are too close to each other
- make planetary distribution configurable so you can specify how many habitable planets, terrestrial planets and giants you want
- implement solo, binary and ternary star systems
- implement satellite and ring generation
- create a commandline interface
- create some kind of graphical output
