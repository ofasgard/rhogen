# rhogen
A star system generator inspired by the Worldbuilding guidelines from Atomic Rockets.

Todo:

- implement some kind of failsafe into system generation so it gives up if it fails to generate planets for too long
- make planetary distribution configurable so you can specify how many habitable planets, terrestrial planets and giants you want
- implement satellite and ring generation
- create a commandline interface with options for output in full JSON/CSV or "MarkDown report" format
- create some kind of graphical output
